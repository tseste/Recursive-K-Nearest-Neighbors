# Recursive-K-Nearest-Neighbors

A Recursive K-Nearest Neighbors(RKNN) algorihm for recommender systems. Developed for my diploma thesis at [Department of Financial and Management Engineering](http://www.fme.aegean.gr), University of Aegean. RKNN overcomes the limitation of the conventional KNN algorithm, which sometimes is unable to find similarities for a (user,item) pair, by recursively making predictions to the neighbors of the user for the asked item. Then, these predictions can be used to make a prediction for the (user, item) pair.
