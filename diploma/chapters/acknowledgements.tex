First of all I would like to thank my supervisors Nicholas Ampazis and
Dimosthenis Drivaliaris for their intense support in all my questions and difficulties
that occurred during the realization of my thesis. Furthermore, I would like
to explicitly express my appreciation for the useful advices provided by
Flwra Sakketoy, the experiment hours and the time she dedicated in reviewing my thesis.
Last but not least, I would like to express my gratitude to my best friends
Andreas Mavridis and Alexandros Athanasoulis for their moral and research support
during the realization of my thesis which was the core part that kept me going
until its completion.
